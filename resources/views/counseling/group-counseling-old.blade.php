            <div class="group-guidelines-content2">
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>1.</strong> Group therapy involves one or more mental health professionals who will lead a small group of members up to 15 members.</li>
                  <li><strong>2.</strong> Group sessions meet once per week and last for around 1&ndash;2 hours.</li>
                  <li><strong>3.</strong> At the beginning of a session, group members will introduce themselves and share their reasons for attending group therapy.</li>
                  <li><strong>4.</strong> The exact activities in group therapy sessions will vary from group to group. All activities tend to focus on promoting open, honest communication and establishing trust between group members and the group leaders.</li>
                  <li><strong>5.</strong> Some groups will have homework assignments with an expectation that every member will complete that assignment. Sharing is optional but strongly encouraged.</li>

            <h2 class="theme-heading-text fs-30 lh-1-4">Group Expectations</h2>

            <div class="group-guidelines-content2">
               <ul>
                  <li><strong><span class="mr-1">1.</span> Attendance:</strong> Regular attendance and commitment to the group are very important. If for any reason a member needs to miss a meeting, they should inform their group leader BEFORE missing the meeting, if at all possible.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="mr-1">2.</span> Confidentiality :</strong> It is expected that all group members will promise to maintain and honor the confidentiality of all.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="mr-1">3.</span> Expression of Thoughts and Feelings :</strong> Group therapy can often invoke strong thoughts and feelings. It is expected that all thoughts and feelings will be expressed with the greatest amount of respect for all group members.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="mr-1">4.</span> Receptivity of Thoughts and Feelings:</strong>As we come together to learn and share, we will commit to working towards understanding that some words and actions of others are just consequences of their Journey in Life and Living and may not be intended to hurt anyone. We will work to extend forgiveness to others when forgiveness is necessary for the self, the group, or any members of the group.<br />
                     <strong>NOTE:</strong> This does not void the <a class="theme-color" href="#0"><u>Exception to a Confidentiality clause</u></a>.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong><span class="mr-1">5.</span> Responsibility:</strong> Each group member must take responsibility for working towards their therapeutic goals and reasons for being in the group. It is up to each member to do their own work.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="mr-1">6.</span> Rules:</strong> Additional group rules and pre-group meetings are usually a part of the group process, and may vary slightly according to the leaders and type of group.</li>
                  <li><strong><span class="mr-1">7.</span> Saying Goodbye:</strong> All members at the end of each group or at the end of the final group session (depending on the group leader, nature, and topic of the group) will be allowed to offer kind salutations to one another and to say goodbye.</li>
