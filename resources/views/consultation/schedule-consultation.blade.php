                     <h4>Informed Consent of Services Performed</h4>
                     <p>Telemedicine involves the use of electronic communications to enable healthcare providers
                         at different locations to share individual patient medical information for the purpose of
                         improving patient care.
                         Providers may include primary care practitioners, specialists, and/or subspecialists. The
                         information may be used for diagnosis,
                         therapy, follow-up and/or education, and may include any of the following:
                     </p>
                     <ul class="list-arrow">
                         <li>Patient medical records</li>
                         <li>Medical images</li>
                         <li>Live two-way audio and video</li>
                         <li>Output data from medical devices and sound and video files</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Electronic systems used will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the
                         confidentiality of patient identification
                         and imaging data and will include measures to safeguard the data and to ensure its integrity
                         against intentional or unintentional corruption.
                     </p>
                     <p>Responsibility for the patient care should remain with the patient's local clinician, if you
                         have one, as does the patient's medical record.</p>

                     <h4>Possible Risks:</h4>

                         telemedicine. These risks include, but may not be limited to:</p>
                     <ul class="list-arrow">
                         <li>In rare cases, the consultant may determine that the transmitted information is of
                             inadequate quality, thus necessitating a face-to-face meeting with the patient, or at least
                             a rescheduled video consult;</li>
                         <li>Delays in medical evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of
                             the equipment;</li>
                         <li>In very rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of
                             personal medical information;</li>
                         <li>In rare cases, a lack of access to complete medical records may result in adverse drug
                             interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors;</li>
                     </ul>

                             written consent.

                         <li>I understand that I have the right to withhold or withdraw my consent to the use of
                             telemedicine in the course of my care at any time,

                             a telemedicine consultation, I understand that some parts of the exam involving physical
                             tests may be conducted by individuals at my location, or at a testing facility, at the
                             direction of the consulting healthcare provider.
                         </li>

                             who may be located in other areas, including out of state.
                         </li>
                         <li>I understand that I may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telemedicine in my

                             scheduling and billing purposes. Others may also be present during the consultation other
                             than my healthcare provider and consulting healthcare provider in order to operate the
                             video equipment. The above mentioned people will all maintain confidentiality of the
                             information obtained. I further understand that I will be informed of their presence in the
                             consultation and thus will have the right to request the following: (1) omit specific
                             details of my medical history/physical examination that are personally sensitive to me; (2)
                             ask non-medical personnel to leave the telemedicine examination room; and/or (3) terminate
                             the consultation at any time.</li>
